<h3 align="justify" >Hello! Welcome back. Now that you've seen how I connected some of the branches of Social Sciences to the problem our country is currently experiencing, it's time to look at each one in depth. Let us start with the first branch of Social Sciences, Political Science. Have you read the article linked above this text? How about the video I provided? Have you observed anything on the pictures pasted? If not, then go ahead and do that.
Like what is mentioned, it is all related to Political Science or Politics. What does this mean? The study of government and politics is referred to as political science. (What Is Political Science?, 2015) Political science is especially useful in teaching individuals how to become citizens. Most importantly, it is necessary to understand the importance of participating in government, from voting to protesting, holding lawmakers accountable, and upholding democratic norms and values in  the classroom and in the public realm. Political scientists are critical in offering these materials. (Smith, 2017)
With this statement, it is evident that Political Science is a key in shaping our lives as citizens of our country.
Not only that, with Social Sciences, we are able to face fundamental issues present in our country by confronting and addressing them through its branches. As seen from the article I linked in this blog, it is observed that Politics is an important tool in helping a society function especially now that we are facing a global crisis. </h3>

<h3 align="justify"> Politics plays a vital role in health affairs; whether it is for better or for worse. Among with everything else, healthcare is political. Trusting it means trusting the
administration itself. In addition, I believe that it is also through this branch of Social Sciences that people are able to make demands and use their voices to hold the government accountable of their actions. How the government responds to the pandemic that our nation is suffering from can be linked through this.</h3>

<h3 align="justify"> Now that I have tackled Political Science, it's time to move on a new branch. We are now going to discuss Psychology. What is this particular branch of Social Sciences? The study of the mind and behavior is known as psychology. It includes the biological, social, and environmental elements that influence how people think, act, and feel.
(Cherry, 2020) Furthermore, Social cognition is a big topic in psychology. The social environment has a direct impact on how people think, learn, perceive, and act. Human activity, too, has an impact on the social environment. This is a good reason why psychology is classified as a social science.
All of these things are linked to the presence of a person in the social world. To put simply, people can gain insights into their own actions and a better knowledge of other people by gaining a broader and deeper understanding of psychology therefore this is another evidence on how a certain branch of social sciences can help face a particular social problem our country continues to struggle with.</h3>

<h3 align="justify">In relation to the article I linked, it specifically talks about how the pandemic is affecting everyone's mental health. With the continous rise of people getting infected, most people are obliged to stay at home. This act can further affect our mental state due to lack of human connections and many more things. With that being said, the social environment we currently experience today contributes to the negative psychological effect that COVID-19 brings. </h3>
