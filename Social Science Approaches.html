<h3 align="justify"> Hello again! Welcome to another discussion of Social Sciences. Now, it's time to focus on Social Science Approaches. Let us begin with the first one on the list, Structural Functionalism. 
What is the meaning of this? Structural Functionalism, often known as Functionalism, focuses on large-scale social structures, social institutions and their interconnections. (Gangwar, 2021)
It is a theory that examines how all of society's structures and institutions interact. Education, health care, family, legal system, economy, media and religion are all examples of society's structures or institutions. (DESCRIPTION OF INTERACTIVE, 2020) Therefore, in simple words, every structure in society collaborates to perform a critical purpose in maintaining society's stability and well-being.
Institutions and people are intertwined; when one alters, either in the institutions or in the people, the other must adjust or compensate to restore balance. Just like everybody
knows, functionalists relate society to the human body; each part of society, like our organs, serves a purpose.
In relation to the article I pasted, we are specifically going to talk about Education and how online classes help/affect society and its economy especially during this pandemic. Amazing, isn't it? Once again, we are able to connect Social Sciences ( Structural Functionalism ) in a addressing this certain conflict. </h3>
<h3 align="justify">  According to Structural Functionalists, education contributes to society's smooth functioning. Educational systems prepare the most qualified people for the most significant roles in society, these people will be able to support the country and its economy in return. Education not only teaches people how to maximize their potential in terms of abilities and thinking, but also how to be decent citizens and get along with others. Therefore, it must be said that Education
indeed have a role for a society to function well for it produces order, stability and productivity. However due to the crisis we are facing right now, online learning seems to be affecting all of us especially our education system thefore we as a society have to adjust in order to reclaim a new sense of system , growth and efficiency.</h3>

<br>
<h3 align="justify"> Next one. We have the Marxism or as many calls it, Social Conflict Theory. Just like before, let us find its definition. Conflict theory, first proposed by Karl Marx, holds that society is perpetually in conflict due to struggle for limited resources. Dominance and power, rather than consensus and compliance, are said to maintain social order in conflict theory. (Hayes, 2020) 
Not only that, wars, revolutions, poverty, discrimination, and domestic violence are just a few examples of societal occurrences that have been explained using this theory. In this Social Science Approach, it explains that there are two types of people in society: those who have power and those who do not. Those in positions of power have the most wealth, status, and privileges, and hence have the ability to restrain the weaker. Exploitation is a possibility. (DESCRIPTION OF INTERACTIVE, 2020) Through this, we are able
to gain a deeper understanding about the struggle our society faces especially when it comes to valued resources. In relation to the article I linked once again, due to the effect of the Pandemic, poverty has gotten worse resulting
to the continous changes in our society. </h3>

<h3 align="justify">In addition, these changes create injustice and inequality among people. Those in the upper class receive priviliges, power and status.
To put this simply, poverty causes people to be separated into different social classes, them being in the lower class. Like what I have mentioned way before, this is deeply rooted in classism, a
norm where people experience discrimination based on the type of society they belong to or also referred to as “class discrimination”. With this being said, I can conclude that Social Science Theory best explains how the difference of social classes affect people and its society.</h3>

<img src="images/symbolic interactionism2.jpg "width="400" height="300">
<br>
<h3 align="justify"> We are down to our last Social Science Approach, Symbolic Interactionism.The symbolic interaction perspective, often known as symbolic interactionism, is a significant framework of sociological theory that is based on the symbolic meaning that people construct and build on throughout social interaction. (Crossman, 2020) In addition to this, Symbolic interaction theory examines society through the subjective interpretations that people assign to objects, events, and behaviors. People are taught to act based on what they believe rather than what is objectively true, therefore objective meanings are outweighed. (Crossman, 2020)
Life experiences and personal events have an impact on the human mind resulting on their own interpretations to certain situations thus Symbolic Interactionism and its established meanings assist us in comprehending, navigating, and adapting to the social environment, another proof on how Social Sciences help confront or address certain matters but what is the connection of Symbolic Interactionism to the article I provided? Well we're about to find that out.</h3>

<h3 align="justify">I believe the statements mentioned here are valid evidences that shows connection to my chosen article. If you were to assess it, people's perspective on getting vaccinated or not is through their own subjective interpretations, vaccines are proven to be effective
as these were conducted through a professional research done by scientists however there are people out there who believe that getting vaccinated can harm them or their health, it is due to the fact that these people think what they believe in is true. Just like what is written , life experiences or some personal events may lead them to this interpretation. Not only that,
they may be influenced by other people's perspective on getting vaccinated or not, with that being said and i reiterate we can also state that how people put meanings or interpretations to certain situations is greatly impacted by social interactions.</h3>
