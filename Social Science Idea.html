<h3 align="justify"> Hello! You are now at the last part of the discussion regarding Social Sciences. Now is the time to talk about Feminist Theory. What exactly is this? 
Feminist theory , often known as feminism, is the belief in complete economic, political, and social equality between men and women. (What is Feminist Theory? - Definition & Overview, 2015) Feminist theory looks at societal issues from both macro and micro viewpoints,  focusing on a gender experience.
Women's experiences, gender roles, and socio-economic inequalities between men and women are the main focus of this theory. On a micro level ,feminist theorists look at how men and women communicate, their views, and their beliefs while they look at the economic institutions and societal ideologies/ beliefs that lead to inequality at the macro level. (DESCRIPTION OF INTERACTIVE, 2020)
Therefore, it must be said, in order to establish change, feminist theory plays a vital role in society.</h3>

<h3 align="justify"> In addition to that, Feminist theory also serves as an analytical framework while simultaneously laying the groundwork for political action. Fighting inequality and oppression requires a dedication to political awareness and activism. We need to establish tactics to liberate society from sexist and misogynist institutions of inequality and oppression if we want to engage in a meaningful political engagement, and feminist theory provides the tools to achieve just that.
( Fattal, 2019) In simple words, this particular Social Science Idea enables us to better comprehend and address gender inequality and oppression because it's true what they say, we won't be able to address something unless we can name it.
In line with the article I pasted once again, this further talks about the constricting civil society space experienced by women, the rampant red-tagging among community women and the resistance against rising misogyny as addressed by Philstar.
In fact, female celebrities like Catriona Gray and Liza Soberano experienced being red-tagged throughout this pandemic. Indeed, the outbreak has heightened women's hardships, particularly for those who face marginalization, exclusion, and other forms of human rights violations. (Philstar, 2021) 
Therefore, I can conclude that the systemic barriers that women face today can be linked through this theory.</h3>
