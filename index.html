<h3 align="justify">Like what the portion of the headline asks " Why do Social Sciences help in addressing social concerns in our country?" A question that has a simple answer.

works, from the causes of unemployment to what promotes economic progress, as well as how and why people vote and what makes people happy.
People learn how to interact with the social world through social sciences, how to influence policy, build networks, raise government accountability, and promote democracy. For many people around the world, these difficulties are urgent, and their resolution can make a significant difference in people's lives.
